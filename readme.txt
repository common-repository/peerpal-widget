PeerPal Widget is a PeerPal product featuring a chat system, which any organization that is a PeerPal customer can embed into their website. PeerPal Widget is hosted on: (https://widget.peerpal.com/), and uses query parameters based on your organization name and color in our database to load relevant data for you.

This official PeerPal Widget plugin makes it easier than ever for organizations using WordPress to implement. The PeerPal Widget shortcode replaces the iframe html tag containing (https://widget.peerpal.com//) and allows you to customize the chat widget. For example, after you input your organization name and color, you can have the widget render to the left with side=‘left’. Additionally, you can control how far off the edge of the screen the widget is by moving it up or pushing it down.
You may use PeerPal Widget shortcode on any page you desire, to embed the chat widget onto your desired webpage.

**Important**: This plugin is meant for PeerPal customers only, please go to our website: https://graduway.com/products/admissions to schedule a demo.
